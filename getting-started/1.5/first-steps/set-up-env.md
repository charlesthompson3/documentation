# Set up a developer environment

**In this tutorial, you set up your device with all the tools you need to write and run code in JavaScript. These tools are called a developer environment.**

In this tutorial, you will learn how to:

1. Install your tools

2. Create your first coding project

2. Install the IOTA core client library

## Why JavaScript

IOTA supports many programming languages, including C, Go, Java, and Python. While all these languages have their own benefits, JavaScript is one of the most popular languages.

Technically, these tutorials use a server-side version of JavaScript called Node.js.

If you have never used JavaScript or Node.js before, you can find some beginner tutorials on [w3schools.com](https://www.w3schools.com/).

## Step 1. Install your tools

In this step, you install the programming tools that make up your developer environment. 

1. Install the [latest long-term support (LTS) version of Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

    Node.js is an open-source server environment that allows you to run JavaScript on the server.

2. Install [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download)

    :::info:
    This is a code editor, which makes it easy to write and run code.

    Feel free to use another code editor if you want.

## Step 2. Create your first coding project

In this step, you create a project, using the node package manager [(npm)](https://www.npmjs.com/) that comes with Node.js. You'll use this project throughout the tutorials in this section.

1. Open a command-line interface

    Depending on your operating system, a command-line interface could be [PowerShell in Windows](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/getting-started/getting-started-with-windows-powershell?view=powershell-6), the [Linux Terminal](https://www.howtogeek.com/140679/beginner-geek-how-to-start-using-the-linux-terminal/) or [Terminal for macOS](https://macpaw.com/how-to/use-terminal-on-mac).

2. Create a new directory to use for your project and change into it

    ```bash
    mkdir iota-tutorial
    cd iota-tutorial
    ```

3. Initialize a new Node.js project

    ```bash
    npm init
    ```

Now you have a `package.json` file, which includes the packages and applications your project depends on, and specific metadata like the project's name, description, and author. Whenever you install packages, those packages will be added to this file as a dependency. For more information, see this excellent [package.json guide](https://flaviocopes.com/package-json/).

## Step 3. Install the IOTA core client library

The IOTA core client library contains the main functionality that you need to develop applications on IOTA. This library is organized in packages. For example, the `core` package contains methods for requesting information from nodes, creating messages, and sending them to nodes. The `unit-converter` package contains methods for representing amounts of IOTA tokens in different units.

All the available packages are listed in the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/iotaledger/iota.js/tree/next/packages).

In a command-line interface, change into the directory where you initialized your project, and install the `core` package, if you haven't already.

```bash
npm install @iota/core @iota/converter
```

If everything went well, you should see something like the following in the output. You can ignore any 'npm WARN' messages.

```shell
+ @iota/core@1.0.0-beta.30
+ @iota/converter@1.0.0-beta.30
added 25 packages from 16 contributors and audited 26 packages in 10.091s
```

After installing a package, you'll have a `node_modules` directory, which contains the `core` package code and its dependencies.

:::success: Congratulations :tada:
You've got all the tools you need and now you're ready to start learning and coding!
